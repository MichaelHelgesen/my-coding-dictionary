**Data:** In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer.

**JavaScript variables:** The variables sole purpose is to store and label data in memory, which can be referenced and manipulated by a computer program. We can think of variables like a container that hold information. The box can be labeled so that we better understand what it contains. 

Another popular analogy is the squid (Marjin Haverbeke) :octopus:. He points out that "we should think of variables as tentacles rather than boxes. They do not contain values; they grasp them". Meaning that if we want to remember something, we need to grow a tentacle and grab on to it, or reattach one of the exsisting ones. A program can only access the values that is has a hold on. A variable without a value is like thin air. There is nothing to hold on to, and thus it is "undefined". 

Either way, the label of the variable points to the data rather than using the data itself, similar to X and Y in mathematics. They are a simple names to represent the data we want to refer to. But computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.


**Data types:** JavaScript contains seven different datatypes which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number and object.
